# Description
The goal of the project is to build a simple app that shows photos of dogs and also allows you to open each photo in a detail view.
Nothing tricky - and should not take too much time.

The basic feature set of the app is:
- Get list of dog photos from the JSON API
- Show a gallery view of all dog photos
- Show a detail view for a single dog photo
- Make the app as user-friendly as you can.

The photo API is available at: https://pugme.herokuapp.com/bomb?count=50

Feel free to write down any suggestions or improvements that you would make in the app given more time to work on it.
